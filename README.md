# Conditional inference With Vine Copulas

This repository contains the code for the arvix paper [Conditional Inferences Based on Vine Copulas with Applications to Credit Spread Data of Corporate Bonds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05606). 
- The file 'biv_cop_utils.r' contains some utility functions used by 'cross_prediction_function.r'.
- The file 'cross_prediction_function.r' implements the function to perform cross prediction based on vine copulas.
- The file 'cross_prediction_example.r' shows an example of using the 'cross_prediction.r' file.
- The file 'conditional_simulation_function.r' implements the function to generate u-scores from an R-vine given that one variable takes a fixed value.
- The file 'conditional_simulation_example.r' shows an example of using the 'conditional_simulation.r' file.
