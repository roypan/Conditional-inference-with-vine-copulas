# Conditional inference With Vine Copulas

This repository contains the code for the arvix paper [Conditional Inferences Based on Vine Copulas with Applications to Credit Spread Data of Corporate Bonds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05606). The file 'cross_prediction.r' implements a function to perform cross prediction based on vine copulas. The file 'cross_prediction_simulation.r' shows an example of using this function. The file 'conditional_simulation.r' implements a function to generate u-scores from an R-vine given that one variable takes a fixed value.
